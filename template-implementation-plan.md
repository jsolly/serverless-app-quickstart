# {{FEATURE_TITLE}} Implementation Roadmap

This document is a template for creating a detailed implementation plan. It will be used by an AI agent to automatically implement features or perform refactoring tasks. The agent will follow the steps sequentially to ensure a successful outcome.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

*A clear and concise description of the problem to be solved or the feature to be implemented.*

{{PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION}}

---

## 2. Definition of Done

*A set of measurable criteria that must be met for the project to be considered complete. This includes functional and non-functional requirements.*

- [ ] {{CRITERION_1}}
- [ ] {{CRITERION_2}}
- [ ] {{CRITERION_3}}

---

## 3. Out of Scope

*A list of items that are explicitly not part of this implementation. This helps to define boundaries for the AI agent.*

- {{OUT_OF_SCOPE_1}}
- {{OUT_OF_SCOPE_2}}

---

## 4. Execution Plan

*A step-by-step breakdown of the tasks required to implement the solution. Each phase should be a logical grouping of related tasks.*

### Phase 1: {{PHASE_1_TITLE}}
- [ ] **Task 1.1:** {{TASK_1_1_DESCRIPTION}}
- [ ] **Task 1.2:** {{TASK_1_2_DESCRIPTION}}
- [ ] **Task 1.3:** {{TASK_1_3_DESCRIPTION}}

### Phase 2: {{PHASE_2_TITLE}}
- [ ] **Task 2.1:** {{TASK_2_1_DESCRIPTION}}
- [ ] **Task 2.2:** {{TASK_2_2_DESCRIPTION}}
- [ ] **Task 2.3:** {{TASK_2_3_DESCRIPTION}}

[Additional phases to be defined]

## 5. Technical Details

### Files to Modify
*List of existing files that need to be changed.*
- `{{FILE_TO_MODIFY_1}}`: {{REASON_FOR_CHANGE_1}}
- `{{FILE_TO_MODIFY_2}}`: {{REASON_FOR_CHANGE_2}}

### New Files to Create
*List of new files to be created.*
- `{{NEW_FILE_1}}`: {{PURPOSE_OF_FILE_1}}
- `{{NEW_FILE_2}}`: {{PURPOSE_OF_FILE_2}}

### Key Dependencies
*List of key libraries, packages, or other dependencies.*
- `{{DEPENDENCY_1}}`: {{REASON_FOR_DEPENDENCY_1}}
- `{{DEPENDENCY_2}}`: {{REASON_FOR_DEPENDENCY_2}}

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

*Potential risks and the plans to mitigate them.*

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| {{RISK_1}} | {{IMPACT_1}} | {{MITIGATION_1}} |
| {{RISK_2}} | {{IMPACT_2}} | {{MITIGATION_2}} |
