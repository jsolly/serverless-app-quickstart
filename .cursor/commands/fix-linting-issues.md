# Fix Linting Issues

Run `npm run fix` to automatically fix linting and formatting issues, then analyze and resolve any remaining problems.

## Steps

1. Execute `npm run fix` to auto-fix issues with Biome
2. Read the output to identify any remaining errors or warnings
3. For each remaining issue:
   - Locate the problematic code
   - Apply the necessary fix
   - Ensure the fix aligns with project coding standards
4. Verify all linting issues are resolved

## Context

This project uses Biome for linting and formatting (no Prettier or ESLint).
